#CSS Defense

I tweaked the goal of the hackathon and decided to create a Tower Defense game using only CSS.  I knew I wasnâ€™t going to be able to implement a real game with only CSS, but I wanted to see just how far I could go with only CSS. 

* When/Where: This project was started at a two-hour minihackathon at [Hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com) on August 21, 2014.
* Goal: Create a Tower Defense game using as few lines of code as possible.
* Tech used: CSS.
* Demo: [CSS Defense Demo](http://nerdycreativity.com/css_defense.html)
* Blog post: [Minihackathon #4](http://nerdycreativity.com/2014/08/24/minihackathon-4/)

Limitations of my CSS-only game: 
* No way to keep score.
* Getting hit by a bullet has no effect.
* Only way to clear the board is to clear the browser history.
